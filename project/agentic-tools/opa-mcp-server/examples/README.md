# Client configuration examples

Drop-in MCP client configurations for `@orygn/opa-mcp`. Pick the file that
matches your client, copy the relevant entry into your client's config, and
edit the environment variables to match your environment.

> ⚠ **Before you save:** the example configs ship with placeholder
> `OPA_BINARY` and `REGAL_BINARY` paths set to `/usr/local/bin/opa` and
> `/usr/local/bin/regal`. **You almost certainly need to change these.**
> Many MCP clients (notably Claude Desktop on Windows and macOS) launch
> with a reduced `PATH` that does not include user-local bin directories,
> so the server cannot find `opa` even when it works fine in your shell.
> Find the absolute paths with:
>
> ```bash
> which opa && which regal                                    # macOS / Linux
> ```
>
> ```powershell
> Get-Command opa, regal | Select-Object Source              # Windows
> ```
>
> Substitute those into the `env` block. Skip this step and you will see
> `OPA_BINARY_NOT_FOUND` on the first tool call.

## Claude Code extras

Two additional files are provided for Claude Code users working in a policy
repo day-to-day:

| File                                               | Purpose                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md)                         | Standing instructions template. Copy to your repo root or `.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Claude Code loads it every session.       |
| [`claude-code-hook.json`](./claude-code-hook.json) | PostToolUse hook config. Merge the `hooks` block into `.claude/settings.json` to run `opa check` on every `.rego` write. |

### Using CLAUDE.md

Copy the file to your policy repo root (or `.claude/CLAUDE.md`) and fill in
the `## Conventions` section at the bottom with your project-specific package
naming, input schema location, test runner command, and any other invariants
you want Claude to know about.

### Using the hook

1. Copy `.claude/settings.json` if it does not already exist in your repo, or
   open the existing one.
2. Merge the `"hooks"` key from `claude-code-hook.json` into it.
3. Ensure `opa` is on `PATH` (or replace `'opa'` in the command string with
   the absolute path).

After that, every time Claude Code writes a `.rego` file the hook runs
`opa check` and reports any syntax errors directly in the session -- no
manual tool call required.

If you do not see your client here, the server itself is just stdio — any
MCP-compliant client can run it via:

```
command:  npx
args:     ["-y", "@orygn/opa-mcp"]
```

## Environment variables

All examples use the same environment variables. The most important are:

- **`OPA_URL`** — base URL of your OPA REST endpoint (default
  `http://localhost:8181`). Required by the `opa_*` tools.
- **`OPA_TOKEN`** — bearer token for OPA, if your instance requires auth.
  **Never commit this to source control.** Use your client's secret-storage
  feature where available.
- **`OPA_BINARY`** — absolute path to the `opa` CLI. The default is
  `opa` (relying on `PATH`), but **you almost always need to set this
  explicitly** — most MCP clients launch the server with a reduced
  `PATH` that omits the directory `opa` lives in.
- **`REGAL_BINARY`** — absolute path to the `regal` linter. Same caveat
  as `OPA_BINARY`. Only used by the `rego_lint` tool, but worth setting
  alongside.
- **`OPA_MCP_ALLOWED_PATHS`** — comma- or semicolon-separated list of
  directories the server is allowed to read policies from. **Required for
  any tool that reads policy files from disk.** When unset, file-based
  tools refuse to run.

The full list — including logging, response-size, and timeout settings — is
in the [main README](../README.md#configuration).

## Two install paths

The example configs all use **`npx -y @orygn/opa-mcp`**, which downloads and
runs the latest published version on demand. This is the simplest path: no
global install, always up to date.

If you would rather pin a version or use a globally installed binary,
substitute:

```
command:  opa-mcp
args:     []
```

…after running `npm install -g @orygn/opa-mcp`, or substitute the Docker
form in [`docker.json`](./docker.json).

## A note on path values

Paths in `OPA_MCP_ALLOWED_PATHS` and the `*_BINARY` variables must be
absolute. JSON does not allow comments, so the placeholder values in these
files (`/path/to/your/policies`, `/usr/local/bin/opa`, etc.) **must be
edited** before the config will work — the server will reject relative
paths and missing binaries with a clear error.
